# SSH Keygen with Docker

Script using darknet inside docker to delete videos or images without person entities detected.

## Requirements
- docker

### Just run me

```
bin/ssh-keygen-github.sh
```

Generates an RSA private and public key that can be used to authenticate with github.

Once the script finishes running the key is placed under
    Private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
    Public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub
